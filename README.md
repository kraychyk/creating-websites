programming

here is a template with which you can start learning how to create websites)
this template was created for a furniture web store

(the Russian language is used there)


index.html this is the home page
about.html this is naturally an about page
the users folder contains html files from which login.html this is the account login page, profile.html is the user's profile page, registration.html this is the account registration page

the other_files folder contains the pages that the user sees with errors: 404, 500.
there are also goods_list.py (roughly speaking, this is how everything should look under the "hood" of your site
notifications.html for "error detection"
sale_banner.html product card

there is a file in the orders folder: create_order.html . this is the checkout page

there are 2 files in the goods folder: catalog.html , and product.html .
catalog.html this is the website directory
product.html this is an expanded product card

Sorry, I'm too lazy to continue.
IMPORTANT, the defs folder contains the base of the site (layout files)
